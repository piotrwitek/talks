## The talk

### Summary

Why and how for testing complex conditional and mapped types in libraries and projects.

### Format

Case Study

### Full description

In many TS libraries as well as in JS libraries using ambient type definitions we can find some advanced mapped types, conditional types or a mix of both. The most common example are utility types like Omit, Diff, etc.
In this talk I would like to show you how you can test your advanced types for correctness which is really useful when dealing with some edge cases and making sure they wonâ€™t happen again.
