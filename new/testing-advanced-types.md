## The talk

### Summary

The why and how of testing complex conditional and mapped types in libraries and projects.

### Format

Case Study

### Full description

In many TS libraries as well as in JS libraries using ambient type definitions we can find some complex mapped types, conditional types or a mix of both. The most common example are utility types like Omit, Diff, etc.
In this talk I would like to show you how you can test your complex types for correctness which can be really useful when dealing with some edge cases in your library code and making sure they wonâ€™t happen again.
